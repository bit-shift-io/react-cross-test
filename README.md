# Test projects

react-native-web (https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/) is used by some frameworks already, so I have some tests below.

reactjs-react-native-elements - testing out https://reactnativeelements.com/docs/installation#using-on-web
This works!

react_native_paper - testing out https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/using-on-the-web.html
Note this need to be installed in a react native project, not a reactjs project!
